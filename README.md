Solution to the problem as proposed by https://www.showclix.com/static/puzzle.html by Aaron Mathisen

This should run on any version of PHP 5.3 or greater. Upload the directory tree anywhere and hit the 'index' page with a browser.

Set the initial conditions for the seating arrangements with the dropdown menus, put your input strings into the text area, and click the 'Generate Seating Chart' button to get your results.

If there are no initial reservations, just keep the first line blank, or simply omit it all together and start your first regular reservations with an integer.
